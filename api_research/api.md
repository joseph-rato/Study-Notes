When I look at a politician I want to see how many times he’s appeared in the news
Check

How many times he’s voted according to party lines vs public opinion check
How many times he’s been consistent on voting measures

Combined check

The campaign contributions he gets
Bar chart that animates when clicked on pulling out data/ changing data apeared and gives links to their website or more information on them

Line chart for politician vs when he appears in the news
line chart? 
Same thing as below events are marked by a different type of dot rather then a bar. Dot changes size depending on how positive or negative it is

Party line votes vs public opinion votes on key topics :  top 10 controversial topics gun/ abortion/ 
moving dot and then when a vote happens on a topic the dot gets saved on the graph then it continues on 
And a bar for yes/no for politician then a bar for the yes no by party totals


Yes vs no on 

There is a moving d3 graph:

thats it for now modify these things to make it look good with data from politicians

steps for tomorrow:

1) do api pull of data based on persons name 
2) once you get data structure the data to be read correctly on d3 graphs. 
3) implement d3 graph examples
4) modify d3 graph examples
5) make css styling nice so it looks good
6) do other tpyes of graphs for other apis 
 
7) move to other project
