Cover letters:
Don't look at cover letters done and completed unless  
Write one because some hiring managers want to see one
Require a cover letter 
    - explain what you can bring to the industry
    - personal connection to the industry
    - blurb say how you can own a project
    - why you want to work on this search industry vs something else
    WHY REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS ARE WHAT? LIKE I WANT TO MAKE MONEY, I SEE PROMISE IN THE INDUSTRY, I SEE A STRONG FUTURE IN THE INDUSTRY, 

Create custom questions why does this make sense to you? what type of answer are you looking for?
Put something in your resume build your identiy as a candiate. 
Thank you letter at the end. 
How to show commitement, 
The first paragraph is not important, cover letter. More personal is better for this part

tech interview
Can you learn can you take ownership of a large project 
if you seem stagnant are you unwilling to learn or learning problems
Learning challenge sieze up bad problems to overcome try to overcome them, explore the options, 
avoid the frustration, train yourself not to sieze up 

DIdn't ask enough questions to layout things, same page same terms. Don't start writing before you do it. dont let them guess what you're doing
You're stuck in your head. Express the meaning to the person that way 

Phone Screen
Dont bypass the recruiter
need to say what you did etc
Being open about your experiance
Ownership of projects? Do you volunteer that evidence? Steer an open ended question?
Show persistances? within the industry?
Consulting/contracting position? Not putting out a huge risk? What are you how much money do you want? Out of sight out of mind? 
Confident and excited all the way through the call
Send a quick note after the call. Say thanks. 


QUESTIONS 
- how do you keep calm when you get frustrated with a problem? when do you reset?
- when you lack experiance should you be totally upfront about your experiance then throw a but in and talk about your project experiance?
