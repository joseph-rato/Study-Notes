# Notes 

### paradigms
- Paradigms === patterns 

### functional programming
- Pure Functions / function purity
- Avoids side Effects
- uses mathmatical functions and avoids shared state and mutable data
- features that allow FP:
    -  first-class functions
    - higher order function
    - functions as arguments/values 

### Difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance 

##### Classical Inheritance
- instances inherit from classes 
- create sub-class relationships
    - hierarchical class taxonomies
    - or tight coupling (maybe because the changes in one class effect many other ones)

##### Prototypal Inheritance
- instances inherit directly from other objects
- instances may be composed from many different objects
    - allows for easy slective inheritance 
    - concatenative inheritance
    - prototype delegation
    - functional inheritance
    - object composition

### What are the pros and cons of functional programming vs OOP?

#### OOP Pros
- easy to understand
- uses an imperative style rather than a delcarative style
    - which reads like a straight-forward set of instructions for the computer to follow 
#### OOP Cons
- OOP typically depends on shared state
- Objects and behaviors are often tracked together on same entity
    - which can be accessed by any amount of other fuctions which can lead to undesirable behavior such as race conditions
#### FP Pros
- Programers avoid any shared state 
- functions tend to be simplified and easily recomposed for more generally reusable code 
- favor declarative and denotational styles
    - which do not spell out step by step instructions for ops 
    - instead concentrate on what to do
        - allows for easy refactoring and performance optimization even allowing for replacement of entire algorithms
- easy to scale across multiple processors or across distributed computing clusters without fear of threading resource conflicts race conditions etc
#### FP Cons
