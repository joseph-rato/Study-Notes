## JavaScript notes 

### `'use strict` 
- makes debugging easier because code that would otherwise have been ignored would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions
- prevents accidental globals
    - throws an error at you 
- Eliminates `this` coercion
    - reference to a `this` value of null or undefined is automatically coerced to the global
- Disallows duplicate parameter values
    - if there are two arguments with the same name throws an error/not allowed
- Makes eval() safer
    - there are some differences in the way eval() behaves in strict mode and non-strict mode 
    - variables and functions declared inside of an eval() statemtnt are not created in the containg scope
    - they are created in non-strict mode 
- Throws error on invalid usage of delete 
    - the delete operator (used to remove properties from objects) can't be used on nonconfigurable properties of the object
    - non-strict mode will have that fail silently while strict mode will throw an error in such a case

### Wrapping entire content of a JavaScript source file in a function block
- Doing this creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries
